1. cylindrical coordinates:
  a. when solving the stream function, the subroutine hwscyl need to be called. 
  b. similarily, calling pressuresolve, using hstcyl routine.
  c. however, change implicit viscosity to display viscosity. 
  d. the subroutine secondsolveuv is not called, and the viscosity term is used in the firstsolveuv routine.
Now, this main program is changed to the initial chorin projection method process.
